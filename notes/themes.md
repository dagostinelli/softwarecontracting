- If the client could do it themselves, they would.
- frameworks get you fired
- don't let them build frameworks (that's for your full timers, not the contractors)

Operational Friction

Consultant's Perspective (how to use it best)
- study in the downtime
- socialize, build the network
- goodwill
- teach
- discuss, improve the collective knowledge
- do not do foolish things with the code because you are bored
- do not introduce experimental technology (you are a contractor)

Client's Perspective (how to avoid)
- minimize foolish requests
- minimize meetings
- create tasks lists, check things off and review weekly
- reprioritize
- watch for operational friction
