## Software Contracting
by Darryl T. Agostinelli

This is the official repository for the work in progress book titled "Software Contracting".

What is a Journeyman?  You are a journeyman when you explain your craft.  That's what this book presently is to me.  While I explain my craft, I hope that it will be useful to you.

This book is a work in progress.

The book is written in open source style, meaning the raw text as well as the typesetting code (called Markdown) is available for you to read, comment on and recommend changes to.  

If you find an issue or have a suggestion, please file an issue here in the GitHub repository.

This is a book that I have decided to write in the open, in the clear, on the web, for all to see.  One of the best things about writing a book online is that you can help me.  You can ask me to clarify something, make comments, find mistakes and so on.  I'm here and willing to take that feedback. 

The way to do it is to file an issue report here on GitHub in the repository.  If you want to just fix the text yourself, you can do that too and send me a pull request or include a patch in the issue report or just write the best you can in the issue report and I will do the work of getting the text updated.  Thank you in advance for whatever contribution you can make!

There's a small, annoying matter of copyright when you make a contribution.  While you are always the author of your contribution, you must assign me the rights that you automatically get as an author of your contribution.  This is done by way of a Contributors License Agreement.

This may be the most practical way to have the material available for you to use.  Instead of spending years writing the text in secret and then reveal it at the end, this way we can all see the text now, comment on it, review it, recommend adjustments but most of all, benefit from it.

Writing a book in the open is scary.  Anyone can dig into the history here and find prior drafts of the work.  I don't mind if you do that, but if you hold it over me in some mean way, I will be disappointed with you.[1]  I suppose that's all I can say on that for now.
